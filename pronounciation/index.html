<p>The relationship between standard Czech spelling and Czech pronunciation is relatively straightforward, compared with a language like
English.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, as with all languages, the beginner who wants to be
able to pronounce the language properly will benefit from access to a
native speaker or at least to some sound recordings.</p>
<p>The following is designed more for the layman than the trained linguist. The reader who wants a more specialised approach will need to
consult other sources.
Czech rules about punctuation and capital letters are slightly different from the conventions of English, but the main features are not hard
to grasp.</p>

</div>
<p>Vowel letters a, e, i/y, o, u represent sounds which are quite close to
the English vowel sounds in ‘tuck, tech, tick, tock, took’ respectively.</p>
<p>There’s no difference in sound between i and y, but the spelling
affects the pronunciation of preceding d, t, n – see below.</p>
<p>With acute signs added (á, é, í/ý, ó, ú) these vowels are pronounced
with longer duration: roughly like English ‘ah, eh, ee, aw, oo’.
The long vowel ú is normally spelt ů (with a kroužek ‘little circle’)
except as the first letter in a word.</p>
<p>Word stress is on the first vowel (long or short).</p>
<p>There are also three diphthongs (diftongy, sequences of two vowels
within a single syllable) in which the first vowel, pronounced as above,
moves into a very short u or w sound.</p>
<p>The commonest is OU:</p>
<p>OU: bouda, malou, náhodou, nesou</p>
<p>The other two diphthongs appear in loanwords:</p>
<p>AU: auto car, automobile, autobus ‘bus’, restaurace ‘restaurant’</p>
<p>EU: pneumatika ‘(pneumatic) tyre’, neutralita ‘neutrality’</p>
<p>Other vowel letter sequences are pronounced as two syllables:
IE: Anglie ‘England’, as if spelt -ije (for J see below)</p>
<p>IO: rádio ‘radio’, as if spelt -ijo</p>
<p>AO: ‘a-o’ e.g. kakao ‘cocoa’</p>
