<p>Consonant letters b, d, f, g (as in ‘good’), h, k, l, m, n, p, s (as in ‘sun’),
t (as in ‘stop’), x and z are pronounced much the same as in English.</p>
<p>However:</p>
<p>K, P, and T lack the typical English ‘post-aspiration’, a slight puff of air
following them, unless they come at the end of a word:</p>
<p style = "text-indent:50px; font-weight: bold;">kilo, ruka, pil, koupil, ten, to, ta</p>
<p>but are post-aspirated in final position in words like: buk, lup, mít.</p>
<p>H is pronounced further back, more deeply, hollowly, than the Eng-
lish equivalent:</p>
<p style = "text-indent:50px; font-weight: bold;">holit, haló, mnoho, nahý</p>
<p>CH must be distinguished from H, and is pronounced like Scottish
‘loch’ (not like a regular English CH):</p>
<p style = "text-indent:50px; font-weight: bold;">chudý, chyba, ucho, chladno</p>
<p>R is briefly trilled, like a Scottish R, and pronounced in all positions:</p>
<p style = "text-indent:50px; font-weight: bold;">rád, ruka, Karel, hora, pár, sestra, horko</p>
<p>Both R and L can act like vowels, creating syllables of their own:</p>
<p style = "text-indent:50px; font-weight: bold;">krk, bratr, plný, nesl</p>
<p>One silly Czech tongue-twister suggests (misleadingly) that the lan-
guage lacks vowels. The saying literally means ‘stick (your) finger
through (your) neck/throat’:</p>
<p style = "text-indent:50px; font-weight: bold;">Strč prst skrz krk.</p>
<p>QU and W turn up in occasional loanwords with retained foreign
spelling.</p>
<p style = "text-indent:50px; font-weight: bold;">western [vestern], WC [vétsé], quasi- (pronounced and more often
spelt kvazi- ).</p>
<p>S is pronounced [z] in words for ‘-isms’ ending in -ismus and in a few
other loanwords and names:</p>
<p style = "text-indent:50px; font-weight: bold;">Josef [ Jozef ], feminismus [feminizmus] (now also spelt -izmus)</p>
<p>The letter X occurs in loanwords, where it is mostly pronounced [ks],
e.g. extra ‘extra’, except in words beginning in ex- plus a vowel, if the
ex- is not perceived as a tacked-on prefix. Here it is pronounced [gz],
e.g. existovat ‘to exist’, exil ‘exile’, exotickp ‘exotic’.
Z is as in English ‘zebra’, e.g. zebra, zima ‘winter’.</p>
