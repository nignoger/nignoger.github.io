<p>This is styled an ‘essential’ grammar, and is certainly not anything like
a comprehensive grammar (mluvnice) of Czech (čeština) – the Czech
language (češký jazyk), with its strong tradition of writing from the late
thirteenth century onwards.</p>
<p>All kinds of choices have had to be made – especially about what to
exclude! – either simply for reasons of space, or in order to try not to
overburden readers who may still be at an elementary level in their
knowledge of the language. (The dangers of over-simplification are of
course ever-present, and the author is all too aware that he may have
succumbed to these at times – he hopes not too often.)
Efforts have been made to separate the basic, core elements from
those which are less central and vital.</p>
<p>Presentation of morphology (declension and conjugation) has been
interspersed with material on usage. A work designed for trained
linguists would arrange this material somewhat differently, no doubt,
but it is hoped that the approach adopted here will be helpful to the
general reader as well as informative for the more academic scholar.
I have tried to take account of readers’ likely unfamiliarity with
various grammatical categories, and with linguistic terminology.
Czech grammatical terms have been infiltrated into the text as well,
for those who go on to encounter them in their further studies or hear
them from their teachers.</p>
<p>The author has no particular theoretical or systematic approach to offer
– this may or may not be a weakness. He has simply tried to steer a
reasonably pragmatic course through the often thorny jungle of this
language – wielding, as he hopes, a not too crude machete in his fist.</p>

</div>
<p>A few words ought perhaps to be said at the outset about how nonstandard spoken Czech is presented here alongside the standard written
forms.</p>
<p>The standard written language (spisovná čeština) differs in various,
at times rather obvious, respects from most Czechs’ everyday spoken
language.</p>
<p>Wherever this book refers to non-standard forms of everyday colloquial language, it is broadly the spoken language of Prague and
Bohemia that is being referred to.</p>
<p>People may refer to this variety as hovorová čeština ‘colloquial Czech’,
while linguists often call it obecná čeština ‘common Czech’ (the former
term has sometimes been used for a slightly relaxed version of the
standard language, avoiding the more literary or ‘bookish’ features, but
still more or less standard in phonetics and grammar).
Non-standard forms are often found in literature – in the texts, especially dialogues, of fiction and plays. They also occur on the radio and
TV, especially in less formal contexts, and anyone living in the Czech
Republic will soon notice these non-standard features even if they only
have a rather basic command of the language.</p>
<p>Differences between written and colloquial usage will be pointed out
throughout this book, rather than being hived off into a separate chapter.
(Non-standard usage is marked by an asterisk.)</p>
<p>Much less attention is devoted to features which readers would mainly
encounter when reading older texts, of the nineteenth century and
earlier. Seventeenth-century Czech writings, such as those of Comenius
(Komenský) are still very accessible to present-day Czech readers, but
this grammar focuses mainly on the present-day language, which is
spoken by around 10 million people in the Czech Republic, as well as
by lesser numbers scattered over the globe.</p>
